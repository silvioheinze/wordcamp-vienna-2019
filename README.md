# Docker â€“ not just for development @ Wordcamp Vienna 2019

Docker is an open source solution to virtualise environments into own containers. This is not only an easy to maintain way of hosting WordPress, but also to have local copies for development and design. This talk will give a quick introduction into the technology and show best practise with WordPress. The focus will be on the processes between development and deployment. Basic level of knowledge in using the terminal on Linux/Mac/Windows is helpful but not needed.

This repository has all the files shown and slides from the talk.
